# My Portfolio Site

Following my Udacity Nanodegree in Full Stack Web Development using JavaScript and TypeScript, I thought it would be a good idea to apply what I learned in the course along with what I learned using Ruby on Rails to build my own portfolio website seeing as I have never had a proper one.

Most of the courses and tutorials I've seen tend to use a database like SQLite3 or PostgreSQL to store their content, but that felt a bit excessive in this case and I was curious about how you'd accomplish content management without SQL.<br>
I had seen videos about making a blog with the articles written in markdown and so far I'm pretty pleased with how it's going. Editing my projects feels like a lot less of a hassle than it would have been.

I also didn't want to bust out something like Angular or React for this because I wanted to have a bit more control with this site for the time being, and [EJS](https://ejs.co/) & [express-ejs-layouts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-ejs-layouts) have been kind to me. It feels consistent with how I'd structure things had I been using Rails or Angular but a lot closer to the node parts of my courses which I'm quite happy with.

Right now I'm pretty happy with the functionality, so now I'll focus on the design and content to make it feel a lot more me.

## To Do

- [ ] Docs
- [ ] User Authentication (just me)
- [ ] Filters for tags
- [ ] Open API routes so I can update the project files without needing to shut down the server and push anything
