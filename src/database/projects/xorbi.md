# XORBI

Website to advertise [XORBI](https://xorbi.earth/), Alt Earth Tours. An AR game currently in development and available for download, created by my friend Farid Enrique Ben Amor.

The site itself is a collaboration between myself as the programmer and [Diana Nguyen](https://dianangu.com/) (go check her out!) as the designer; built using React and hosted using Cloudflare Pages.

All of the animations were done using [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) animation library. For me, personally, the most difficult aspect was the implementation of the seamlessly scrolling grid for the image gallery. Since I had never used the library prior to this project there was a bit of a learning curve when it came to implementing it inside of react. Despite there being one or two visual bugs to be ironed out, I am quite plased with the result!
