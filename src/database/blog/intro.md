Welcome!
============

This feels like it's been a long time coming. 

During college I wasn't really that into web development, but I felt a portfolio site was something that I should have at some point. At the time I didn't really have anything to really put on it so it'd be like building a bookshelf without owning any books, so I put it off.

Years passed, and while I had started to build my portfolio, the idea of having a website was pushed to the back of my mind because of my day job and every day life.

At the start of this year, I enrolled in a Full Stack Developer course from Udacity and I finally acquired the skills needed to check this off the list, so here we are!
<br>I always have a long list of things I need to do, and sometimes years pass but I always get the things on that list done eventually. 

I decided to base my website's design on my revamped CV from the start of 2019. Before then I thought my resume looked kind of boring. (I guess in hindsight, it still is a little boring)

<br>
<div class="text-center">
  <img width="40%" src="/blog/intro/cv_2018.png"> <img width="40%" src="/blog/intro/cv_2019.png">
</div>
<br>

But the point is, I wanted to add a splash of character. I find it a lot more visually appealing than it used to be and I matched my current website to it because consistency is pretty neat.

I frankensteined the backend and frontend from what I was taught in the Udacity course, some Bootstrap that I applied during my Ruby on Rails tutorial binge and random tutorials from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and I can't say I'm disappointed with the result.
<br>Naturally I'll continue to work on this site on and off, and I'll eventually sculpt it into something more exciting as my design work gets more sophisticated, but I like to think this is a good place to start (though I'll probably come back in the next few days to spruce some things up if I find some time).

But either way, thanks for sticking around.
