It's been quite a while, huh.
============

The last time I wrote here, I had just finished my web development courses and hobbled a portfolio site together. Fast forawrd 2 years and I have to say that I'm impressed by my project organization and less than impressed by my CSS skills.

I never thought I'd be a Web Development Man(tm) but over the past 2 years I've gotten a job as a React developer and have become fairly comfortable and confident in my software abilities as a whole. I've made progress on many projects during this time, learned a lot of React (of course), FINALLY finished the bulk of my studies & training and even started to play guitar more seriously. When I look back I can't help but be proud of the progress I've made professionally and personally.

Based on what I've learned last year, I can already feel that 2023 onwards will be a real shift in pace from the previous years. There is a lot in the shop and I'm excited to bring my visions into reality!

For this year, namely I'm looking to:
- Finish v1.0 of the [dialogue editor](/projects/dialogue) I've been working on 
- Polish up the [Dungeon Generator](/projects/dungeon-generator), maybe even dabble in some OpenGL & DearImgui
- Finish [Night Shift](/projects/night-shift) by Halloween this year
- Get into music production & composing on guitar and with LMMS, Famitracker and maybe Cakewalk
- Finish Satellite
- Get started on Love AfterLife and Ronin

It's a daunting amount of work but I'm excited to give it my best and I'm excited to break my limits and liberate my mind from its own barriers. Wish me luck!

Welcome to version 1.1
